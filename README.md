# Fruitify
 A SwiftUI application demonstrating asynchronous data loading, image loading, animations, navigation and a lot of UI stuff. This is my learning project and if you are new to SwiftUI, it can be a good project to understand basic concepts practically.

# Concepts Used

- Asynchronous data loading using Alamofire
- Asynchronous image loading using URLImage
- Animations including confetti view (Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Kavsoft/videos">Kavsoft</a>)
- Navigation between different screens
- LazyVGrid to lazily load items when visible on the screen and thus improve performance
- Combining small views to form a larger view equivalent to a screen
